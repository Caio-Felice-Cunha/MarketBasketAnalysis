## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> For this project, MySQL was used as the database for storage. Data was collected from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arules/index.html)

Companies that can benefit from this method are mainly Retail, but companies like Netflix can also apply this analysis. <br>
With the technology and variety of products that the stores have (as well as the diversity in services), it is essential that the company knows the consumption pattern of its customers, but how to do that?<br>
One way to solve this problem is Market Basket Analysis. Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.

## Business Assumptions
It was assumed that the business wants to sell more products or services and obtains the purchase history of its customers.
What are the main products that customers want to buy?<br>
Once he has consumed in the store, what are the next products he is likely to buy?

## Solution Strategy
For that, I used RStudio.
* Step 01: Conection with MySQL;
* Step 02: Importing and Cleaning properly the dataset;
* Step 03: Check missing values;
* Step 04: Converting the variables to factor type;
* Step 05: Inspection of the rules;
* Step 06: Filtering the top 03 rules.


## Data Insights
We want to prove that there is a certain purchase pattern, where consumers, after purchasing product A, will probably buy product B or product C next

## Business Results
For this business, we have seen that products such as "Dust-Off Compressed Gas 2 pack", "HP 61 ink" and "VIVO Dual LCD Monitor Desk mount" are the most sought after products after the first purchases, therefore, it is important to ensure that you always have these products in stock, as well as leave them as a recommendation to the customer.

## Conclusions
Although human beings are not completely predictable, there is a certain standardization in how we behave and this reflects in our way of consuming, therefore, understanding how buying patterns work will give a market advantage to those who apply Market Basket Analysis.

## Next Steps
* Improve the parameters to more accurately predict the products that will be consumed after the first purchases.
* Understand the correlation between variables

## Disclaimer 
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning course (part of the Data Scientist training)
